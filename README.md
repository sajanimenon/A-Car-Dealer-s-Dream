BACKGROUND
We are nationwide cable company with a extensive database of customer data. Our database is highly confidential and maintains all ethical norms. 
We the Business Intelligence at CoolCable were approached for a 2020 project idea with a goal to increase revenue. 
What you will see is a POC that was put together to request funding.

About US
Data is knowledge. Using the data and insights we have about our data, we have created an interactive dashboard for Car dealers. 
This website will be a one stop shop for car dealers to find their next customer. A car dealer can browse through our website, enter their criteria requirements for an email, phone or mail campaigns and purchase the required dataset for a nominal fee. 

Source 
The database is based on real authentic data and contains information of only those customers who are willing to share their credentials and has been built over regular surveys conducted by the CoolCable marketing research team.
